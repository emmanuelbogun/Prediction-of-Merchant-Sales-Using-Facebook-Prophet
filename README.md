# Prediction-of-Merchant-Sales-Using-Facebook-Prophet
In this project, Facebook Prophet was used for forecasting the sales of the individual merchant of a franchise to predict their sales for every day for the next three months.

Facebook Prophet is a forecasting library developed by Facebook. It combines time series decomposition, trend modeling, and seasonality estimation to provide accurate forecasts. Prophet also handles missing data and outliers effectively. Facebook Prophet is effective because it shows trends, weekly, daily, monthly, and yearly trends all at once. It was used here because it gives a more overview in a few lines of code.

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
